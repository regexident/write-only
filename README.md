## Synopsis

Rust references/slices that provide write-access, but no read-access.

## Motivation

Sometimes is is desirable to only provide write-access to a value or slice of values without also providing read-access.

This is where `write-only` comes in handy!

## Usage

Write-only reference:

```rust
use write_only::{prelude::*, Put};

fn write<T: Put<u8>>(write_only: &mut T) {
    write_only.put(42u8);
}

let mut value: u8 = 0;

let mut write_only = WriteOnlyRef::from(&mut value);
write(&mut write_only);

assert_eq!(value, 42);
```

Write-only slice:

```rust
use write_only::{prelude::*, PutAt};

fn write<T: PutAt<u8>>(write_only: &mut T) {
    write_only.put_at(2, 42u8);
}

let mut values: Vec<u8> = (0..10).collect();

let mut write_only = WriteOnlySlice::from(&mut values[..]);
write(&mut write_only);

assert_eq!(values[2], 42u8);
```
